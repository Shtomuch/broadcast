Description:

"broadcast is a dynamic university project developed using the Python-based Django web framework. At its core, the project integrates seamlessly with Jitsi Meet to provide robust video conferencing and real-time communication capabilities.

The platform is designed to facilitate online interactions by allowing users to:

Manage user accounts and profiles.
Create, discover, and participate in topic-based chat rooms.
Launch and join secure Jitsi video meetings directly through the application.
This project served as a valuable and engaging learning experience, offering practical insights into full-stack web development, user authentication, real-time communication technologies, and the integration of third-party services like Jitsi Meet within a Django application. The development journey was an enjoyable exploration of building interactive web solutions."
